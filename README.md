This bot does the following:
1. Harvest plants
2. Remove plants (only if farming stage is cancelled and no LE to be harvested)
3. Plant plants depending on season. If there are no plants/mothertree available, it would plant sunflowers. If there are no sunflowers, it will buy 1 for you. If you don't have enough LE to buy, it will just continue.
4. Water your plants
5. Scare crows off your plants
6. Add at most 2 pots on your plants
